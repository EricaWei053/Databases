Content: 
This directory contains all the files I implemented or used to complete HW3. 

Testing: 
tests directory only contains one test file because I wrote all test in one file to keep track on debug. Output file will be saved in test_output directory as test1_output.txt 

test1.py will need a little bit time to complete all tests, some of them take over 10 seconds. Please wait for it, thanks! They are all passed. 

I used BattingSamll.cvs instead of Batting.cvs because there are some duplicated keys in Batting. 


Implementation: 
In src directory, most main implementation are learned from Professor, some small change by myself(like choosing list or dictionaries, if return results) to successfully run the tests. 
The CSV file will be saved in DB directory as json format if we call save().
